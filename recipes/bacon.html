    <h2>Bacon Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      Preparing this bacon is literally the first thing I do after I wake up on
      weekend mornings. I put the bacon in the cold oven, set it to 425 F, brush
      my teeth, start cooking other breakfast items, and then take the bacon out
      after 14 minutes â€” that's it! My theory is that by placing the bacon in a
      cold oven to start, as the oven gradually heats, the bacon undergoes a
      magical transformation from a cold, flabby piece of meat to crispy bacon
      heaven as the oven hits the 425-degree mark.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package thick-cut bacon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Line a large baking sheet with 2 sheets aluminum foil, making sure the
        sheet is completely covered.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange bacon strips 1/2-inch apart on the prepared baking sheet. Place
        in the cold oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Cook bacon for 14
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer cooked bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool for 5
        minutes for bacon to crisp.
      </li>
