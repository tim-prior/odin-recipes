    <h2>Penne Recipe</h2>
    <p>Quick and easy pasta dinner that takes less than 30 minutes!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
      <li>½ pound ground sausage</li>
      <li>1 (1.2 ounce) package creamy pesto sauce mix (such as Knorr®)</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook penne at a
        boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11
        minutes; drain and transfer pasta to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the
        hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; add to pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk pesto sauce mix, milk, and olive oil together in a small saucepan;
        bring to a boil while stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and keep
        at a simmer until thickened, about 3 minutes; pour over pasta and
        sausage mixture and toss to coat.
